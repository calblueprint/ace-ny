This project is being built by a team at [Blueprint](https://calblueprint.org), a student organization at the University of California, Berkeley building software pro bono for nonprofits.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Check your installation of `node` and `pnpm`:

```bash
node -v
pnpm -v
```

We strongly recommend using a Node version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (for Mac) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) (for Windows) to install Node.js. If you don't plan on switching between different Node versions, you can alternatively get a [prebuilt installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer) from the Node.js website for an easier approach. Make sure to get Node version 18 and up, the latest LTS version should be sufficient.

After installing Node, you most likely have npm installed as well (check by running `npm -v`). If you have npm installed, simply run `npm install -g pnpm` to install pnpm. If your command line does not recognize npm as a command, refer to [this article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-resolve-npm-command-not-found-error-in-node-js/) to troubleshoot.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo & install dependencies

   1. Clone this repo
      - using SSH (recommended)
        ```bash
        git clone git@github.com:calblueprint/ace-ny.git
        ```
      - using HTTPS
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/calblueprint/ace-ny.git
        ```
   2. Enter the cloned directory
      ```bash
      cd ace-ny
      ```
   3. Install project dependencies. This command installs all packages from [`package.json`](package.json).
      ```bash
      pnpm install
      ```

2. Set up secrets:
   1. In the project's root directory (`ace-ny/`), create a new file named `.env.local`
   2. Copy the credentials from [Blueprint's internal Notion](https://www.notion.so/calblueprint/Welcome-Gift-for-Devs-62579b8d14fb4a56860184ff7fc33f39) (access is required) and paste them into the `.env.local` file.
